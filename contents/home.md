I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Aerospace Engineering at MIT, with an expected graduation of Fall 2025. My research is on applying autonomy to remote sensing in order to improve our capabilities to measure clouds. I've done this by designing a satellite system that receives contextual information up upcoming measurements. I've developed multiple algorithms for prioritizing measurements, balalncing scientific value and instrument capabilities. I've also analyzed the instrumentation that would best provide scientific value and work in a dynamic environment. To test these configurations, I built a tool that simulates the performance of the satellite. Through this, I can assess different combinations of factors: algorithms, instruments, number of satellites, and plenty more. 

Outside my PhD, I enjoy creative writing, tabletop games, and building whatever I can imagine out of the makerspace.
